# Rain-Alert-Application-
The idea of the Rain Alert application came to mind when we forget to take an umbrella with us. 
It is an application that uses the weather API, sending an SMS alert to take an umbrella with you if the weather is rainy.
Before using the code you have to first setup your Twilio and api_key.
